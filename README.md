# Shop-Verse API

## Overview
Shop-Verse API is a backend service for an e-commerce platform that supports multiple user roles including customers, brand owners, and super admins. It provides RESTful endpoints for product browsing, order management, user authentication, and administrative functions. The API uses JWT-based authentication with Devise and role-based authorization with Pundit (though custom role checks are primarily used).
